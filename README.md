# Lotto_Generator

I made this simple web application of a lotto generator with Django and Heroku for personal use and fun. The app makes sure just one attempt is allowed so that the user (I) can make her mind to use the numbers generated instead of attempting several times, considering if the numbers will be the winners. A preference for numbers won't help you be a winner! It's all random!  
To generate another set of numbers, just refresh the page and click the corresponding buttons.

The app has been deployed [here](https://luckylottonumbers.herokuapp.com/). Click and have a little taste!
